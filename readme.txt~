Introduction
------------
	
	This project build for Quasar and Skyinn's projects development.All projects build
with Ant(http://ant.apache.org),it defined many tasks to build,test,generate,deploy...

	If all the tasks defined in one build.xml file,it will be too large and confusing.
So I defined these tasks in several files,and in build.xml defined some targets to call
these build-XXX.xml.It like Java's Interface(or Abstract class) and it's Implements,
the "build.xml" is just an INTERFACE,and the "build-XXX.xml" is it's IMPLEMENTS.
So you can write other build-XXX.xml file and call it in build.xml like I did.
	And this is NOT one-size-fit-all project,so I suggest you to read these files first
then to modify to fit your projects.

Installing and Using
--------------------

	You must install JDK(1.3 or later) and Ant(1.4 or later) first,then
	1. Define an environment variable "JAVA_HOME" that points at the base directory 
	of your JDK installation,and add the directory "$JAVA_HOME/bin" to your PATH 
	variable.
	
	2. Define an environment variable "ANT_HOME" that points at the base directory 
	of your Ant installation,and add the directory "$ANT_HOME/bin" to your PATH 
	variable.
	
	3. Copy these files to your project's base directory,DO NOT modify the "script"
	directory name,if you did,you must modify the properties.ant and build.properties
	with the "script.dir" property or others all.
	
	e.g - my Quasar project directory will looks like this:
		/Quasar
			/build.xml
			/script
			/src
			/...
	
	4. Type "ant TARGET_NAME" in the DOS cmd or Linux shell to run the ant tasks.
	
	5. You can run the targets in script just like:
		/script>ant -f build-XXX.xml TARGET_NAME
	
	6. For help infomation,type "ant help" or "ant -f build-XXX.xml help",it will 
	print the key targets for the using ant build file.
	

Some file list
---------------
	
- default ant build file:
		\build.xml
	
- base tasks:
		\script\build-base.xml
		it defined several basic target like :clear,compile,jalopy,etc.
		
- package tasks:
		\script\build-cvs.xml
		jar,war,etc.
		
- deploy tasks:
		\script\build-deploy.xml
		\script\build-deploy-tomcat.xml
		\script\build-deploy-resin.xml
		defined deploy and undeploy targets.Some application server defined their 
	deploy file by named build-deply-APPSERVER.xml.In build-deploy.xml,you can call
	the right app server's deploy file.
	
- test tasks:
		\script\build-test.xml
		JUnit test target and test report,etc.
	
- generate tasks:
		\scipt\build-generate.xml
		generate JavaDoc and HTML format srouce code.
	
- cvs tasks:
		\script\build-cvs.xml
		some target for cvs's commit,update,etc.
		
- ftp tasks:
		\script\build-ftp.xml
		ftp upload,download.
		
TODO List
---------
	- build-optional.xml: for japloy,pmd,checkstyle,todo,etc.
	- build-continue.xml: for continue build and auto test.
	- other build tasks...

	If I have mistake with these build files or you have better files and if you 
have other build files,please mail me(walker@skyinn.org) and I will update these.

	THANKS:-)
